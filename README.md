3D VR Tour 

3D VR Tour is designed as a template for Engineering Visualization of 3D models, which allows users to view 3D models in panoramic space on a mobile device. These 3D models are created in Autodesk Maya, and are rendered using Unreal Engine 4. 3D VR Tour also allows users to share design concepts and ideas by sharing URL links. The application itself is written in Javascript and uses the WebVR Starter Kit to allow for easy portability.
